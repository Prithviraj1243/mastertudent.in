I already have a working website (masterstudent.in) with login and landing pages. Students can log in either to download notes or upload notes. I now want to add/improve features. Below are the requirements in user story format.

🔹 General Login

As a student, when I log in, I should see a welcome message from Masterstudent.

🔹 Download Notes Flow

Category & Exam Selection

As a student, after login for downloading, I should see categories:

Classes 9th–12th

Entrance Exams

Government Exams

College Exams

As a student, when I click on a category, I should be able to select a specific class/exam (e.g., CBSE Class 10th, ICSE Class 9th, JEE, NEET, UPSC, etc.).

As a student, after selecting, I should see a Next button to move ahead.

Subject & Notes Access

As a student, when I click Next, I should see subject-wise categories.

As a student, when I select a subject, I should see:

Topic names

Name of uploader

Number of downloads

Rating

Reviews or comments

Subscription & Access Control

As a student, I can only view notes inside the website (no downloads to device allowed for protection).

As a student, I must have a valid subscription to view notes.

As a student, before subscribing, I must select my class/exam.

As a student, my subscription should only give access to the class/exam I chose.

Feedback

As a student, I should be able to rate and give feedback on notes I viewed.

🔹 Upload Notes Flow

Upload Options

As an uploader student, I should have fields to:

Upload PDF

Enter topic name

Select exam category for notes

Enter details about myself (uploader info)

Admin Review

As an uploader, once I upload, notes should go to the Admin Dashboard under the correct exam category.

As an admin, I can accept or reject notes.

As an admin, I must give a detailed reason (min 200 words) when accepting or rejecting notes.

🔹 Uploader Student Dashboard

As an uploader, I should have a profile/personal dashboard where I can:

See how many notes I’ve uploaded.

See feedback/comments on my notes.

Check my wallet balance (earnings).

🔹 Wallet & Payments

Withdrawal Requests

As an uploader, I should be able to request withdrawal of my wallet money.

As an uploader, I can only withdraw if my balance is at least ₹200.

Admin Settlement

As an admin, I should see withdrawal requests.

As an admin, I can manually settle payments (e.g., via UPI/Bank).

As an admin, once I confirm payment, the amount should be removed from the uploader’s wallet balance.

✅ Please implement these features step by step with a clean, user-friendly interface for both students and admins.
