PHYSICS NOTES - KINEMATICS
==========================

Chapter 1: Motion in One Dimension

1. BASIC CONCEPTS
   - Position: Location of an object in space
   - Displacement: Change in position (vector quantity)
   - Distance: Total path traveled (scalar quantity)
   - Velocity: Rate of change of displacement
   - Speed: Rate of change of distance

2. EQUATIONS OF MOTION
   For constant acceleration:
   
   v = u + at
   s = ut + (1/2)at²
   v² = u² + 2as
   
   Where:
   - u = initial velocity
   - v = final velocity
   - a = acceleration
   - t = time
   - s = displacement

3. GRAPHICAL ANALYSIS
   - Position-time graphs
   - Velocity-time graphs
   - Acceleration-time graphs

4. EXAMPLES
   Example 1: A car accelerates from rest at 2 m/s² for 10 seconds.
   Find: Final velocity and distance traveled
   
   Solution:
   u = 0 m/s, a = 2 m/s², t = 10 s
   v = u + at = 0 + 2(10) = 20 m/s
   s = ut + (1/2)at² = 0 + (1/2)(2)(10)² = 100 m

5. PRACTICE PROBLEMS
   1. A ball is thrown upward with initial velocity 20 m/s. Find maximum height.
   2. A train decelerates from 30 m/s to rest in 15 seconds. Find deceleration.
   3. An object falls from height 45 m. Find time to reach ground.

Note: These are fundamental concepts in physics that form the basis for more advanced topics.
